      <h2>Dear Gloria,</h2>

      <p>
        As we gather here under the golden hues of autumn to celebrate your 20th
        birthday, we are reminded of the beautiful symphony that is your life.
        Each year is a new movement, filled with its own unique melodies and
        harmonies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your love for music is infectious. It's as if each note you play on your
        violin resonates within our hearts. And who could forget your culinary
        adventures? Each dish is like a new composition, filled with exciting
        flavors and textures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Watching you play the violin is like witnessing a virtuoso at work, even
        if it's only once. The sweet melodies you create are a testament to your
        talent and passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reconnecting with you has been like discovering a long-lost piece of
        music, movies, series and most important, friendship. Our shared
        interests in horror movies and our mutual bouts of laziness have added a
        touch of humor to our lives. And let's not forget our playful
        speculations about your supposed psychic abilities!
      </p>

      <p>
        But beneath all the jokes and laughter lies a serious ambition. We, no I
        have no doubt that you will excel in your chosen field of psychology.
        Who knows? You might even uncover the secret psychology behind musicians
        who write songs about laziness!
      </p>

      <p>
        So here's to another year of beautiful music, delicious food, shared
        laughter, and new adventures. Happy birthday, Gloria!
      </p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p><i>Your forever out-of-tune but in perfect harmony friend</i></p>
      <p><i>Me, Myself and I</i></p>
